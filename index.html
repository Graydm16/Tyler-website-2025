<p> Medium Demons start to get to the part where none of the levels are easy and they're all  hard. The gameplay gets tighter, there’s more fakes, there's more orbs, and the speed ramps up. Some of these levels could actually be hard demons but for some reason there are not. Deadlocked was argued to be a Medium Demon but was then confirmed it was an Easy Demon. Two of the most popular creator levels that are rated Medium Demon are Theory of Skrillix by   do


<h2> My Top 5 Favorite Extreme Demons </h2>


<h3> My 5th Favorite Extreme Demon </h3>

<p> My 5th favorite Extreme Demon is BLOODLUST created by Knobbelboy. It's basically a remake but more detailed of BLOODBATH. Its length is extra long and it's one of my favorite Extreme Demons because of the gameplay and detail. The BLOODLUST monster is probably one of my favorite details in GD. The gameplay looks very hard and surprisingly looks really fun. I love BLOODBATH so seeing a level with better detail but also having its own personal touch makes it one of my favorites. <p>

<h3> My 4th Favorite Extreme Demon </h3>

<p> My 4th favorite Extreme Demon is YATAGARASU created by TrusTa. This level is one of my favorite Extreme Demons because of its gameplay. It goes from invisible spikes to orb tricks. From extremely hard wave gameplay, to fast robot gameplay this level is super hard. It is also an extra long level so there's tons of good gameplay. The vibe is super cool and this is why it's my 4th favorite Extreme Demon. <p>

<h3> My 3rd Favorite Extreme Demon </h3> 

<p> My 3rd favorite Extreme Demon is CATACLYSM. Even though this is a very Easy Extreme and I myself have 8% on it, it's a very cool level. CATACLYSM has a very hard wave with very tight inputs to really hard ball gameplay with lots of memory. Even though it is a pretty short level, the hard parts of the level bring it up to one of my favorites.  <p>

<h3> My 2nd Favorite Extreme Demon </h3>

<p> My 2nd favorite Extreme Demon is BLOODBATH. This level is so iconic to Geometry Dash and has amazing gameplay and detail. Even though the detail isn't as good as some other levels the vibe, music, and gameplay give people the chills. All the gameplay is amazing from ship to wave and from ball to ufo. The speed, portals, and everything is just amazing about this level. The inputs you have to get through make it devastatingly hard because it's almost frame perfect. When you see what I mean about this level you'll know how great everything is. </p>

<h3> My favorite Extreme Demon </h3>

<p> My Favorite Extreme Demon is SLAUGHTERHOUSE! This level is in the top 10 hardest Extreme Demons and even though it's a super short extreme, the gameplay of this level is extraordinary extreme. The start of the level is the easiest with some really hard jumps that are basically frame perfect with some fakes. Then the level gets to x4 speed which is the fastest speed and gives some of the hardest gameplay ever. The wave and ship are devastatingly hard. There's spam, straight fly, frame perfect spaces, and much more. Let’s just say you get a lot more than you think you will from the amount of time it takes to beat this Extreme Demon. The song syncs perfectly and it even gives you the chills. This is why SLAUGHTERHOUSE is my favorite extreme demon. </p>
